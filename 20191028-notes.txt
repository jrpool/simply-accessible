There are plugins for ESLint that apply axe-core.

stylelint-a11y is a set of custom linting rules for a11y. One example: a rule that requires an h1 with tabindex=-1, motivated by VoiceOver bug that requires this to make skip-nav link work.

jest-axe uses axe-core and usable with jest.

storybook is a tool for code reviews and includes an a11y add-on

cf axe-android, axe-ios

automated testing catches c. 25% of issues.

Test in VMs on whichever OS you are not using.

Make a11y a precondition for production.

Make testing pervasive during dev process (including in the code editor), so developers can't escape the results.

Make a11y a requirement for all developers, not 1 specialist.
