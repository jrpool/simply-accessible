Attest versus Siteimprove versus ARC
10 February 2020

Introduction
Which browser-based accessibility checker is best: axe (or its commercial counterpart WorldSpace Attest), Siteimprove, or ARC Toolkit?
A first comparison was performed on the web page:
Attest was configured to report errors at WCAG 2.1 level AA and poor practices. Siteimprove was configured to report errors at WCAG level AA and warnings. ARC Toolkit was configured to report visible and hidden errors and warnings.
Attest was version 2.8.0, with axe ruleset version 3.4.1, updated on 18 December 2019. Siteimprove was version 125, updated on 15 November 2019. ARC Toolkit was version 3.3.2.0, updated on ??????.

Legend:
* SC = WCAG success criterion
* WA = WorldSpaceAttest error count
* SI = Siteimprove error count
* ARC = ARC error count
* True = whether the reported errors were true errors

Comparison
Attest found some issues that Siteimprove and ARC did not find:
* "tablist" elements that had no "tab" children
* Absence of a "main" landmark element
Siteimprove found some issues that Attest and ARC did not find:
* A link distinguishable from the surrounding text only by color
* Multiple links going to different destinations but with identical texts
* Elements with role="menuitem" but with invalid aria-expanded attributes
ARC found some issues that Attest and Siteimprove did not find:
* Text marked important by an inline element not accessible to assistive technologies
* Dubious use of "br" element
* Description hidden from assistive technologies
* Links without text
* Buttons without text
* Texts of "title" attributes not accessible in keyboard navigation
* Links without destinations
* Inactive elements focusable
* Conflicting label types on same elements
* Use of "aria-label" attribute on dubious elements
Attest wrongly found a non-error:
* role="button" claimed invalid on "h2" element, but not invalid
Siteimprove wrongly found a non-error:
* Elements with role="tablist" and "aria-controls" attributes, claimed to be invalid on those elements, but not invalid
Siteimprove found a quasi-non-error:
* Three errors that would have been true, except that the elements had style property "display: none" (however, if one assumes that the "display" property is sometimes changed to a value other than "none", then those errors would become true, so identifying them is probably beneficial)
ARC did not wrongly find any non-errors.
All three tools failed to find errors more serious than the ones they found, such as:
* Invisible focusable elements
* Nonheadings coded as headings
* Non-tablists coded as tablists
* A menu that can be opened but not closed with a keyboard
* A table with row-group headers coded as column headers and associated with unrelated cells
* A layer that prevents users from seeing focusable elements in the main content
Siteimprove and ARC offer more comprehensive warnings (i.e. things to check that the tool cannot decide on) than Attest. In this case, Siteimprove gave 11 warnings, of which 7 warned of actual errors. ARC gave 9 warnings, of which 7 warned of actual errors. Attest gave 1 warning, and it did not warn of any actual errors. Warnings may act as page-specific checklists, helping developers not to overlook likely error causes.
Siteimprove has a more efficient user interface than ARC or Attest. The UIs are similar, but Siteimprove shows the user all the applicable WCAG success-criterion IDs and the A or AA levels in the main results window. Attest, however, forces the user to click on an error type to get a detail pane, and then click on the "Learn more" link in the detail pane to get an external page, in order to see each individual error's WCAG success criterion. Even then, Attest never shows the A or AA level. ARC provides no links to either success criterion IDs or A or AA levels.
The comparison could be extended to more pages. This page, however, contains a table, a form, layer, and hidable regions, so it is reasonably representative.
The classification of error and warning results was approximate, in the interest of comparability and time-saving. This report is not precise enough to be used for claims of defects in any of the tools described.
