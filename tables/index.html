    <h1>Can Tables Be Accessible?</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>Tables are not accessible: Here is why</h2>
    <p>It is possible to create tables in an HTML document that conform to the standards of accessibility. But users who consume tables by means of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, will not easily understand the tables unless those technologies, too, support the same standards. As of 2020, the most popular screen readers do so with serious imperfections. Making tables simple improves the experience of such users (and perhaps many other users). For even better experiences you can offer optional alternatives to tables. When you offer alternatives, be careful, because some non-table structures, too, are mangled by some assistive technologies.</p>
